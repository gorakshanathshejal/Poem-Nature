Through laughter and tears, you've been my guide,
In this friendship's embrace, forever we'll abide.
Side by side, hand in hand, we face life's bends,
Best friends forever, a love that never ends


On Independence Day, our spirits soar high,
A celebration of freedom, beneath the azure sky.
A day to honor the brave, who fought and stood strong,
For a nation united, where liberty belongs.
